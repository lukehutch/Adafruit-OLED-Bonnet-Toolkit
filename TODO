- Add Hanja chars to font
- Make all drives mount in sync mode

- Add setup notes:
  - [N/A?] Add user "pi" to "disk" group so that they can manually mount and unmount and format disks without needing to type a password.
    (without this, disks end up getting owned by root when they get mounted using sudo):
    sudo usermod -a -G disk pi
  - Enable I2C and set data rate to 1Mbaud in config file
  - Disable graphical startup, and any unnecessary services
  - Add systemd task to start program
