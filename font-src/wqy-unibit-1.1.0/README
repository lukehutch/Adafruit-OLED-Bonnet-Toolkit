 I. Introduction

The Wen Quan Yi Unibit is designed as a dual-width (16x16,16x8) 
bitmap font to provide the most complete international symbol 
coverage, serving as the system-wide fall-back font. This font 
has covered more than 46000 Unicode code points in BMP.
It is intended to supersede the outdated GNU Unifont.

This font was created by merging the latest update of GNU 
Unifont [GPL] (by Roman Czyborra and David Starner et al., the 
font was last updated in 2004), WenQuanYi Bitmap Song [GPL] 
0.8.1 (by Qianqian Fang and WenQuanYi contributors) and 
Fixed-16x8 [public domain] bitmap fonts from X11 core fonts. 
The entire CJK Unified Ideographics (U4E00-U9FA5) and CJK Unified 
Ideographics Extension A(U3400-U4DB5) blocks were replaced by 
high-quality glyphs from China National Standard GB19966-2005 
(public domain). Near a thousand of non-CJK characters were improved by 
WenQuanYi contributors via their collaborative font editing website at

    http://wenq.org/eindex.cgi?Unicode_Chart_EN

You are welcome to logon this website and modify/add glyphs to this 
font.

 II. About The WenQuanYi Project

The Wen Quan Yi Project was created by Qianqian Fang[8] in 
Oct. 2004. The goal of this project is to enrich open-source 
Chinese software/resources and construct an open language
platform for Eastern Asia (Chinese, Japanese and Korean etc) 
open source communities. The initial focus of the project is
to create high quality bitmap character glyphs and outline 
fonts for all 70,000+ CJK characters currently encoded 
by the Unicode Consortium. 

The Wen Quan Yi Project use Wiki[1] as the primary 
development tool for glyph creation, documentation
and coordinations. The Wen Quan Yi wiki also supports
glyph CVS and nightly build.

The embodiment of the project consists of a 
"Steering Committee" by the core members, a "Team B" 
for bitmap Chinese font development and a "Team V" 
for outline font development. Need to mention, a large 
number of anonymous contributors also participate our 
development through our Wiki website and their 
contributions are non-negligible.
